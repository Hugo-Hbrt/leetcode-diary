# leetcode-diary

This repository contains my journey to master Data Structures and Algorithms using LeetCode.
The progress is automatically updated by github actions using scripts that will count in the repo all solved problems,
and will generate / update READMEs accordingly.

## üìä Total progress : 34 problems solved.

- Languages: Python
- Platforms: [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/)
